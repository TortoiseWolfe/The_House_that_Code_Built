# GitHub Pages Deployment Debug Report

## Issue Summary
We've encountered persistent issues with GitHub Pages deployments through GitHub Actions. Despite multiple approaches and configurations, the deployment workflow consistently fails with the error: "No uploaded artifact was found!" 

## Environment Information
- Repository: The_House_that_Code_Built
- Default branch: main
- GitHub Pages configured to deploy from: GitHub Actions
- Current workflow file: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`

## Error Details
```
deploy
Error: No uploaded artifact was found! Please check if there are any errors at build step, or uploaded artifact name is correct.

## Attempted Solutions

### Approach 1: Standard GitHub Pages Workflow
Used the standard GitHub Pages workflow with default configurations:
```yaml
- name: Upload artifact
  uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
  with:
    path: _site
```

**Result**: Failed with "No uploaded artifact was found"

### Approach 2: Different Action Versions
Tried various versions of the GitHub Pages actions:
- actions/upload-pages-artifact@v1, v2, v3
- actions/deploy-pages@v1, v2, v3, v4

**Result**: 
- v4 doesn't exist: "Unable to resolve action `actions/upload-pages-artifact@v4`"
- v3 was reported as deprecated
- v1 and v2 still failed with the same artifact error

### Approach 3: Directory Path Configurations
Tried various directory path configurations:
- `path: _site`
- `path: ./_site`
- Creating directories explicitly with `mkdir -p`
- Full path verification with `realpath` and debug output

**Result**: No change in the error message

### Approach 4: Simplified Content
Reduced the workflow to the absolute minimum:
- Single 'Hello World' index.html
- Debug output of directory contents and paths
- No additional files or SVGs

**Result**: Still failed with the same artifact error

### Approach 5: Heredoc Syntax
Tried various approaches to HTML generation:
- Using heredoc with different delimiters
- Single-line echo commands
- Avoiding heredoc syntax entirely

**Result**: Sometimes resolved YAML syntax errors but not the artifact issue

## GitHub Actions Debug Output

### Directory Structure
Creating a standard directory structure with standard naming:
```
mkdir -p ./_site
echo "Hello World" > ./_site/index.html
```

Debug output verified the files exist:
```
Current working directory: /home/runner/work/The_House_that_Code_Built/The_House_that_Code_Built
Site directory contents:
./_site/index.html
_site absolute path: /home/runner/work/The_House_that_Code_Built/The_House_that_Code_Built/_site
```

## Theories and Further Investigation

### 1. GitHub Runner Environment
The issue may be specific to the GitHub Actions runner environment. The debug output shows files are being created successfully, but the artifact upload step cannot find them.

### 2. Repository Permissions
The workflow has the correct permissions:
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
```
But there could be repository-specific settings preventing proper artifact handling.

### 3. GitHub Pages Configuration
The GitHub Pages settings in the repository might need reconfiguration. Currently set to deploy from GitHub Actions, but this could be conflicting with other settings.

### 4. Competing Workflows
There might be competing workflows in the repository. A full examination of all workflow files and GitHub repository settings should be conducted.

### 5. GitHub Actions Cache Issues
There could be an issue with cached artifacts or previous failed deployments interfering with new attempts.

## Three-Column Layout Implementation
Despite the deployment issues, the three-column layout implementation with 25%-55%-20% proportions is correctly implemented in both the Flask application and the static site:

```css
.left-column {
  width: 25%;
  flex: 0 0 25%;
}

.center-column {
  width: 55%;
  flex: 0 0 55%;
}

.right-column {
  width: 20%;
  flex: 0 0 20%;
}
```

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Check Repository Settings**:
   - Go to the repository's Settings â†’ Pages
   - Ensure "Source" is set to "GitHub Actions"
   - Clear any previous deployment settings

2. **Validate Through GitHub UI**:
   - Create a simple workflow file directly through GitHub's web interface
   - Use GitHub's built-in workflow editor to ensure syntax is correct

3. **Contact GitHub Support**:
   - If issues persist, this could be a bug in GitHub Actions or Pages
   - Contact GitHub Support with all debugging information

4. **Alternative Deployment Method**:
   - Consider deploying from a branch directly instead of using GitHub Actions
   - Create a gh-pages branch with static content and configure Pages to deploy from that branch
